# Resilient Oracle

Resilient oracle is the price oracle that the [Venus Protocol](https://app.venus.io) interacts with for fetching price of assets.

DeFi Protocols are usually vulnerable to price oracles reporting incorrect prices. There are various ways in which oracle prices can be manipulated depending on the type of price oracle used which can create a single point of failure and opens several ways for attacking the protocol.

Keeping this in mind, we have designed a resilient oracle which uses multiple oracle sources to validate prices and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect from oracle attacks. Currently it includes integrations with Chainlink, Pyth, Binance Oracle and TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles. TWAP uses PancakeSwap as the on-chain price source.

## Details

The way the Resilient Oracle works is for every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source.

To validate the price between two oracles we set an **upper** and **lower** bound ratio for every market. The **upper bound ratio** represents the **deviation** between **reported prices** (price from oracle thatâ€™s being validated) and anchor price (price from oracle we are validating against) beyond which the reported price will be invalidated. And the **lower bound ratio** presents the **deviation** between **reported price and anchor price** below which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement should be true:

```
anchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice
isValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio
```

We usually use Chainlink as the main oracle, TWAP or Pyth oracle as pivot oracle depending on which supports the given market and binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle. For some markets we may use Pyth or TWAP as the main oracle if the token price is not supported by Chainlink or Binance oracles.

When fetching an oracle price, for the price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.

# Development

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS - 14.x

- Solc - v0.8.13 (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.13)

## Installing

```

yarn install

```

## Linting and code formatting

Linting is done using eslint for typescript and solhint for solidity. Prettier is used to format solidity and typescript files.

To check linting and formatting on all files run:

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

Linting command can be run with the fix flag to fix eligible errors automatically

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol --fix
$ yarn lint:ts --fix
```

To pretty all files run:

```sh
$ yarn prettier
```

## Run Tests

```

npx hardhat test

```

- To run fork tests add FORK_MAINNET=true PRIVATE_KEY and QUICK_NODE_KEY in the .env file.

## Releases and Versioning

Releases are automatically managed using semantic-release and commit messages.

## Deployment

```

npx hardhat deploy

```

- This command will execute all the deployment scripts in `./deploy` directory
- The default network will be `hardhat`
- Deployment to another network: - Make sure the desired network is configured in `hardhat.config.ts` - Add `PRIVATE_KEY` variable in `.env` file - Execute deploy command by adding `--network <network_name>` in the deploy command above - E.g. `npx hardhat deploy --network bsctestnet`
- Execution of single or custom set of scripts is possible, if:
  - In the deployment scripts you have added `tags` for example: - `func.tags = ["MockTokens"];`
  - Once this is done, adding `--tags "<tag_name>,<tag_name>..."` to the deployment command will execute only the scripts containing the tags.

## Verify Contracts

```
npx hardhat etherscan-verify --network <network-name>
```

## Hardhat Commands

```

npx hardhat accounts

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat clean

npx hardhat test

npx hardhat node

npx hardhat help

REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

npx hardhat coverage

TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts

npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'

npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix

npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check

npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write

npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'

npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix

```
