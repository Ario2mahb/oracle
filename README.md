## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an environment
variable. Follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain artifacts:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Linting and code formatting

Linting is done using eslint for typescript and solhint for solidity. Prettier is used to format solidity and typescript files.

To check linting and formatting on all files run:

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

Linting command can be run with the fix flag to fix eligible errors automatically

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol --fix
$ yarn lint:ts --fix
```

To pretty all files run:

```sh
$ yarn prettier
```

### Test

Run the Mocha tests:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy --greeting "Bonjour, le monde!" --network bsctestnet
```

### Verify

Verify the contracts through `hardhat-deploy`

```sh
$ yarn etherscan-verify --network bsctestnet
```

## Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can enjoy syntax highlighting for your Solidity code via the [hardhat-vscode](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode) extension.

## Caveats

### Ethers and Waffle

If you can't get the [Waffle matchers](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html) to work, try to
make your `ethers` package version match the version used by the `@ethereum-waffle/chai` package. Seem
[#111](https://github.com/paulrberg/solidity-template/issues/111) for more details.
